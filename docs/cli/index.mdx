# CLI Overview

StatikAPI provides two command-line tools to help you work efficiently:

- **`statikapi`** — the core CLI used to develop and build your static JSON API.
- **`create-statikapi`** — the scaffolding tool to quickly start new projects with templates and deploy presets.

Use them together to go from setup to production in minutes.
