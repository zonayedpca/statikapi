# Cloudflare Pages & R2

Cloudflare is an excellent choice for hosting small or medium static JSON APIs —  
especially if you’re already hosting your frontend or documentation there.

---

## ✅ Using Cloudflare Pages

You can deploy your `api-out/` folder directly to **Cloudflare Pages**:

```bash
npx wrangler pages publish api-out --project-name my-statikapi
```

This works great for:
- Small APIs
- Public demo endpoints
- Combined projects (e.g., your docs + JSON API in one Pages site)

Your JSON files will be served from the same CDN edge network that powers Pages.

> **Example URL**
> ```
> https://my-statikapi.pages.dev/api/users/1/index.json
> ```

## ⚠️ Fair Usage Policy

Cloudflare Pages is primarily designed for **websites**, not large API systems.  
If you plan to serve thousands of JSON files or expect high traffic, review their **fair use policy** and bandwidth limits.

**In short:**
- Occasional JSON requests are fine ✅  
- API-like workloads with heavy access may be rate-limited or blocked ❌  
- Pages cache and limits vary per plan — always check the [Cloudflare Pages Terms of Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits/) and related usage rules.

## 💡 For Larger Projects — Use R2

If your StatikAPI project produces **many JSON files** or large objects, host them in **Cloudflare R2**:

1. Upload the entire `api-out/` folder to R2:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 object put my-bucket --file api-out
   ```

2. Configure public access or route it via a Worker:
   ```js
   export default {
     async fetch(request) {
       // Proxy JSON files from R2
     }
   };
   ```

R2 gives you:
- Better scalability and cost control
- API-friendly object storage
- Freedom from Pages file limits

> **Best practice:**  
> - For small JSON sets or static sites → Pages ✅  
> - For large datasets or API-style serving → R2 💪  
> - Always follow Cloudflare’s latest policies and ToS.
