# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages can serve JSON files just like regular static assets.

---

## Manual Deployment

You can manually commit and push your `api-out/` directory to a branch or folder used by GitHub Pages.

```bash
git add api-out
git commit -m "Add API output"
git subtree push --prefix api-out origin gh-pages
```

Your endpoints will be publicly accessible at:

```
https://username.github.io/repo-name/users/1/index.json
```

---

## Git Integration

GitHub Pages automatically builds and serves content from specific branches (`gh-pages`, `main`, or `docs/` folders depending on settings).  
Once your repository is configured for Pages, any push to the target branch will trigger an automatic redeploy of your static JSON API.

---

## Automation with GitHub Actions

You can automate your StatikAPI build and deployment using **GitHub Actions**.

Example workflow snippet:

```yaml
name: Deploy StatikAPI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build API
        run: npx statikapi build
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./api-out
```

This workflow ensures that every commit to `main` automatically rebuilds and deploys your JSON endpoints to GitHub Pages.

## Considerations

- Best for **small APIs**, demos, and documentation datasets.
- GitHub Pages has limited bandwidth and file size per repository.
- For **larger or dynamic datasets**, consider using **Cloudflare R2**, **Amazon S3**, or another CDN-backed object storage.
- You can also host your APIs directly with **StatikAPI Cloud** _(coming soon)_ — a managed hosting platform with automatic builds, caching, and versioned JSON hosting.
