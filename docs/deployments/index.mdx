# Deployments Overview

Once you've built your API with `statikapi build`, the result is a folder of **pure JSON files**.  
That means you can deploy it **anywhere that serves static files** — just like a static site.

Popular targets include:
- **Cloudflare Pages or R2**
- **Netlify**
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Amazon S3 / CloudFront**
- Any static host or CDN (Vercel, Firebase, DigitalOcean, etc.)

Each page below explains how to publish your `api-out/` folder to these platforms.
