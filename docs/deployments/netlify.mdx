# Netlify

Deploy your `api-out/` directory like any static site.

```bash
netlify deploy --dir=api-out --prod
```

Netlify automatically serves `.json` files with proper headers and global CDN caching.

**Example URL**
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/users/1/index.json
```

> Works best for small and medium APIs.  
> For large data sets, consider using object storage (S3, R2, etc.).
