# Netlify

Netlify makes it easy to deploy your `api-out/` directory just like any static website.

---

## Using the CLI

You can deploy directly from your local build output:

```bash
netlify deploy --dir=api-out --prod
```

Netlify will automatically detect and serve `.json` files with the correct headers and global CDN caching.

**Example URL**
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/users/1/index.json
```

---

## Git Integration

You can connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) directly to Netlify.  
Every time you push new commits to the configured branch (usually `main`), Netlify automatically triggers a new build and redeploys your project.

For StatikAPI projects, this means any update to your `api-out/` directory or the source code that generates it can automatically rebuild and publish your static JSON API.

---

## Build Hooks & CI/CD Integration

Netlify supports **build hooks** that can be used to trigger new builds from external systems or workflows.  
This works well with StatikAPI automation or continuous deployment setups.

Example flow:
1. StatikAPI runs `statikapi build` locally or in CI.
2. Once finished, your CI or Worker calls the Netlify build hook URL.
3. Netlify pulls the latest changes from your repo (if connected) and redeploys automatically.

This approach allows seamless automated publishing when your data or endpoints are rebuilt.

## Considerations

Netlify’s CDN and caching system efficiently serve JSON files globally.  
However:
- It’s best suited for **small to medium** API workloads.
- For **larger datasets** or high-traffic APIs, consider using an object storage solution such as **Amazon S3** or **Cloudflare R2**.
- You can also host your APIs directly with **StatikAPI Cloud** *(coming soon)* — a managed hosting platform for static JSON APIs with automatic builds and versioned deployments.

## Recommendation

- For small, simple JSON endpoints or demo APIs → use **Netlify**
- For larger or frequently updated datasets → use **S3**, **R2**, or another object storage service
- Always ensure your build directory (`api-out/`) is correctly configured in your [Configuration](../config)
