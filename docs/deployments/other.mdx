# Other Providers

Any provider that supports static hosting can serve your generated JSON files.

**Examples**
- **Vercel** (via static export or public directory)
- **Firebase Hosting**
- **DigitalOcean Spaces**
- **Render**
- **Surge.sh**

Simply upload your `api-out/` directory and point your routes accordingly.

> 💡 Tip:  
> Use a CDN (Cloudflare, Fastly, BunnyCDN, etc.) in front of your JSON hosting for faster global delivery.
