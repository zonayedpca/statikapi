# Other Providers

Any provider that supports **static hosting** can serve your generated JSON files.  
The process is typically the same — upload your `api-out/` directory and map your routes.

---

## Common Providers

### Vercel

You can deploy your JSON files through **Vercel** either by:

- placing them under the `public/` directory in an existing project, or
- using **Vercel CLI** to deploy `api-out/` directly:
  ```bash
  vercel --prod api-out
  ```

### Firebase Hosting

Firebase supports static file hosting.  
Simply add your build directory in `firebase.json`:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "api-out"
  }
}
```

Then deploy:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

### DigitalOcean Spaces

Use `s3cmd` or the AWS CLI to sync files:

```bash
aws s3 sync api-out s3://my-space-name --endpoint-url https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
```

### Render

Render can serve static content from any folder.  
Create a new **Static Site** and point it to your `api-out/` folder.

### Surge.sh

You can deploy instantly using the Surge CLI:

```bash
npx surge api-out myapi.surge.sh
```

## Performance Tip

Use a **CDN layer** (Cloudflare, Fastly, BunnyCDN, or similar) in front of your JSON hosting for faster global delivery and caching.

---

## Considerations

- These services are best suited for **small to medium** JSON projects or API prototypes.
- For larger datasets or high-traffic APIs, prefer **object storage** solutions like **Cloudflare R2** or **Amazon S3**.
- You can also host your APIs directly with **StatikAPI Cloud** _(coming soon)_ — a managed platform for static JSON APIs with automatic builds, versioned deployments, and integrated CDN caching.
